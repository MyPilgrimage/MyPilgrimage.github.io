## Who am I?

I'm a 32 year old man, living in the Netherlands. <br/>
I've tried, multiple times, to find my "calling in life" (*and failing..*).
I am currently unemployed due to mental-health issues and I had to move back in with my parents.
With no relationship, children, owned-property or other important long term commitments,
*I find myself on a crossroad in life.* <br/>


My hobbies include gaming, airsoft, longboarding, making music, cosplay (i.e. making costumes) and other ways to express myself creatively.
I've always been fascinated with history, culture, politics and the whole “state of the world.”
A bit of an amateur anthropologist, you might say.
With the world heading the way it is heading; Climate change, Class divide, Rising xenophobia and the constant increase in cost-of-living.
I feel I need an escape, something that would give me a new perspective on life,
*and hopefully in the process, find a new way to live.* <br/>


I've made stupid mistakes in my past. Trusted people who weren't worth it and let myself be abused and misused.
This has made it untenable for me to stay, with all the ghosts of my past, dragging me down into a depressive spiral.
*I need an escape.* <br/>


For all these reasons and more, <br/>
*I've decided to go on my Pilgrimage.* <br/>
I'm planning to hoist my backpack on my back and start walking Southward. <br/>
*Towards the Sun.* <br/>

## Why this page?

_"Way of St. James pilgrims (1568)"<br/> ~by [<i class='fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-fw'></i> Roland zh <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Roland_zh )._
{: .w-50 .right }


This page is my progress-tracker, I will post my preparations and training. <br/>


What do I think I need to take with me and how can I best prepare? <br/>
I'm planning on walking all the way, so good shoes and good posture is a must! <br/>


Also I would like to use this page as my "travel log" or Blog.
I'm sure there are a lot of people in similar situations as mine.
This is why I write in English, to lower the language barrier.
I might translate everything into my native Dutch at one point, but sometimes I feel it's easier to express myself in English.
And yes I know, my grammar and syntax aren't very good, but that's the same for me in Dutch, <br/>
**I'm not very talented as a writer.** <br/>

<div class='clearfix'></div>

But if this page could be a point of inspiration, or the push someone else needs to make the first step,
*If only one person sees this and it inspires them, I would be so honoured.*
It would be the greatest thing I've done with my life up to this point. <br/>


So to all whom find this page, <br/>
**Welcome!** <br/>
I hope to inspire you or at the very least, entertain you! <br/>

## My Principle

![My Remote-work Office](/assets/pics/20250304_MyOffice.jpg)
_**My Remote-work Office**<br/> This is where I do most of the work on this page._
{: .img .right .w-25 } 


> <i class='fas fa-quote-left fa-2x'></i>
Leave only ash, hair and footprints.
<sup><i class='fas fa-quote-right'></i></sup> <br/>
{: .quote }


Based on [the **L**eave **n**o **T**race principle. <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://lnt.org/why/7-principles/) <br/>
The Idea is that I don't want to make a negative impact on the world around me. My travels and existence should not hinder nature or anybody else.
I already practice this principle in my day-to-day life, always making sure I do not leave anything behind. <br/>

<div class='clearfix'></div>
So why the addition of **Ash** and **Hair**? <br/>


![My Remote-work Office - LoAHF](/assets/pics/20250306_MyEmptyOffice.jpg)
_**My Remote-work Office - LoAHF**<br/> Leave only Ash, Hair and Footprints!_
{: .img .left .w-25 }


I have long hair. Every human being sheds hair, skin follicles, sweat etc. These last two are harder to see with the naked-eye. But my long hair is sometimes noticeable if I brush my hair outside.
Another thing is that I smoke, and while the filter will go into the bin, I don't think the little bits of cigarette-ash that falls off will have a big impact. 
(feel free to correct me if I'm wrong!)

<br class='clearfix'/>

Again I don't think these few hairs will have any meaningful impact on nature nor the place I'm at. <br/>


Of Course I can not NOT leave foot-prints while walking.
But I think I do need to permit myself to "exist" and leave traces of my existence.
So along with the ash and hair I will leave behind on the regular, these are the "necessary evils" of me wanting to hike and travel.
But if I can help it, I want to leave the places I've been, better than I found them. <br/>


**Cleaning my own garbage is the least I can do!**

## Route

> [ in the **Quick Overview** section, <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://MyPilgrimage.github.io/welcome#quick-overview) <br/>
> but for now this is the most likely route!
{: .prompt-tip }


![Approximate map of the Route](/assets/img/wiki/Ways_of_St._James_in_Europe.png)
_"Approximate Map of the Way of St. James in Europe."<br/> ~by [<i class='fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-fw'></i> Manfred Zentgraf, Volkach Germany <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://www.jakobuspilger-zentgraf.de/ )._
{: .w-50 .right }


As mentioned in the introductions, I'm planning on walking Southward. <br/>


I'll start walking from my parents home in North-Holland,
I'm think I'm going to walk the [<i class='fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-fw'></i> *Pilgrimage of Compostela* <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://en.m.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago).
Simply because it's a known route, it has historical significance (and I love history!) and I think I might meet like-minded people along the way. <br/>

<br class='clearfix'/>

### But first I'll do a Trial-Run.

> I want to start a Trial-Run this August of 2025. <br/>
> [<i class='far fa-calendar fa-fw'></i> See the **Countdown** <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://MyPilgrimage.github.io/welcome#quick-overview) <br/>

![Floris V Path: LAW 1-3](/assets/img/about/LAW_1_3-light.png){: .light }

{: .w-50 .right }


This gives me a bit of time to prepare and get my walking gear in order.
Also to train a bit and see if a Pilgrimage is even something I would want to see through to the end.
This will give me ample opportunity to see if I forgot something, need better preparations, or change my plan entirely. <br/>


For this trail run I'm thinking of walking the **Floris V path**, 
also known as **the "LAW" 1-3**. 
The Floris V path is a part of **the GR12**. 


<div class='clearfix'></div>

{: .prompt-info }


I think I will at least try to get to the border of The Netherlands, in the South at the province of Zeeland.
Once there I will figure out if I want to return or keep going on the route of **the GR12.**

{: .prompt-info }


<div class='clearfix'></div>


#### Why wait till August?

I'm planning to start my Trial-Run on the 10<sup>th</sup> of August. <br/>
I know it would be smarter to start walking in April/May, I still have a few things I want to do in 2025. <br/>


For example; I really want to go to a festival on the first weekend of August. <br/>

> <i class='fas fa-quote-left fa-2x fa-fw'></i> Castlefest is a total experience with lots of music, fantasy writers, themed catering, medieval crafts and a large market which offers everything a fantasy fan could want... <i class='fas fa-quote-right fa-fw'></i><br/>
> ~Castlefest.nl/en
{: .quote .w-50 .right }


<small>*31<sup>st</sup> of July - 3<sup>th</sup> of August*</small> <br/>
It's called [<i class='fas fa-chess-rook fa-fw'></i> **Castlefest** <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://castlefest.nl/en)


The later date also gives me ample opportunity to train and collect my needed gear.
And I think I don't mind the idea that the weather will get colder and the days shorter on my Trial-Run.
It feels like I'm preparing for the worst situation, so when I leave for the real Pilgrimage, I will be ready for (*almost*) anything!


<br class='clearfix'/>


#### What Route do I want to take?

The plan is to start walking from my home near Alkmaar.
1. From Alkmaar walk towards Haarlem.
2. From Haarlem to Amsterdam.
3. The third stage of the "Floris V Pad" starts at Amsterdam.
4. So from here I will follow the Route of the "Floris V Pad".

### The real Pilgrimage Route.

{: .w-50 .right }


The Trial-Run is in preparation for the real Pilgrimage.
I'm thinking of follow the route of **Camino de Santiago**.

It's a very well known Pilgrimage route, which has its advantages, such as hostels and other accommodations. 


<div class='clearfix'></div>

> [<i class='fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-fw'></i> Camino de Santiago <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://en.m.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago)
{: .prompt-info .center }


Starting from my parents home near Alkmaar in North-Holland, walking toward Haarlem.
Haarlem is a common starting point of the Pilgrimage, according to "Routes in Belgium and the Netherlands" on Wikipedia.

> [<i class='fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-fw'></i> Routes in Belgium and the Netherlands <sup>ENG</sup> <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://en.m.Wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_de_Santiago_(route_descriptions)#In_Belgium_and_the_Netherlands) <br/>
{: .prompt-info }

Or Amsterdam for the "Pilgrims Pad LAW 7" (*Pilgrims Path*)

> [<i class='fab fa-wikipedia-w fa-fw'></i> Pilgrims Pad <sup>NL</sup> <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelgrimspad)

{: .w-50 .left }


1. From Alkmaar walk towards Haarlem. <br/>
2. *A.* From Haarlem, I could make my way to Amsterdam and start on the "Pilgrims pad" towards Wezet (*Visé*) in Belgium; <br/>
   *B.* Or take a more direct route from Haarlem to Brussels; <br/>
3. *A.* Then from either Wezet or Brussels to Paris; <br/>
   *B.* Or conclude somewhere in Belgium, that I've walked enough and only walk the "Pilgrims pad" for now. <br/>
   But if I do choose to continue; <br/>
4. set Paris as my "mid" point and the start of the Pilgrims path **"The Camino Francés"** <br/>
   (*or "French Way"*),
   The "French Way" is the easiest route and 
   I don't think I can take a difficult route on my first try. <br/>


**As the route is difficult enough as-is!**

### Thoughts on the Routes

Even though the less traveled and less popular routes do sound more attractive to me.
**"The Camino Primitivo"**, 
sounds the most interesting to me, 
because of its historical significance.
And because it will probably be less "tourist-y" <br/>

**But we will see when and if we get there.**

## Training

Start walking. A bit further every time.


### How am I training?


![Roman bridge over the river Órbigo](/assets/img/wiki/Hospital_de_%C3%93rbigo_%28496110133%29.jpg)
_"Roman bridge with 19 arches over the river Órbigo. The bridge has been integrated into the modern Camino Francés."<br/> ~by [<i class='fab fa-flickr fa-fw'></i> José Antonio Gil Martínez <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square fa-fw'></i>](https://www.flickr.com/people/17364971@N00) ._
{: .w-50 .left }


With music in my ears, I already like walking as a pastime. <br/>
I have no idea how long I can walk for, in <small>km</small>, but I can walk at a steady pace for about an hour before my feet hurt.
Also I will need to go to my GP, to get a podiatrist to look at my wonky feet.
I know I'm not walking correctly, with a bit of "knock-kneed legs" (*or X-legs*).
So something like correcting-soles would be a must have, or else I might permanently damage my legs and knees. <br/>


<div class='clearfix'></div>

I have a small "regimen" of power and endurance training I do bi-daily (*every other day*) consisting of:
- 15x Push-Up
- 15x Sit-Ups
- 15x 10<small>kg</small> halter each arm
- 10x Squads with halters
- 60sec Planking <br/>


I still need to include Crunches, but I don't seem to get the technique right, or it doesn't feel right, I don't know. (*Might need to ask my GP*) <br/>


### Training Preparations

What are things I want to train for? What do I expect to encounter along the way?

![A small campfire](/assets/pics/20230529_Campfire.jpg)
_A small campfire_
{: .w-50 .right }


#### Making Miles

A Pilgrimage means walking a whole lot, and making a bit of progress is important to keep spirits high.
From walking 5 <small>km</small> to 10 <small>km</small> to eventually about 20/25 <small>km</small> per day. <br/>


#### Enduring Elevation

As a Dutchman I'm not used to elevation changes, so I'll need to prepare for this too.
The plan is to go to the Dunes and practice with elevation and rougher terrain. <br/>


#### Beast of Burden

I will need to carry all of my belongings on my back;
A tent, sleeping gear, clothes and food are just the basics, and this will easily add-up in weight.
So I need to practice walking with a heavy load on my shoulders. <br/>


#### Self-sufficient Survivalist

Being self-sufficient and having a bit of survival knowhow could be very useful on the way.
So I'll need to educate myself in the way of the survivalist. <br/>


<br class='clearfix'/>

-----

## Gear

What do I need? A checklist of sorts.


### What gear do I have?

![My Cosplay Backpack](/assets/pics/20210617_FunnyBackpack.png)
_One of my smaller backpacks I use for Cosplay. This was a wasteland-survivor outfit._
{: .w-50 .right }


I have a military-backpack for foot soldiers,
It has a lumbar support and thick padded shoulder straps. I will need to check if it's still waterproof!
And I already have military-boots,
in a fairly new condition, but I'm not sure if they are too heavy for me? Maybe I need to find more modern walking boots?
A simple first-aid kit, with band-aid, a flea-nipper, a few painkillers and a refresher on first aid knowledge is very useful. <br/>
The rest of my gear I will need to acquire... <br/>


The main issue is weight. <br/>
I could bring my tent with me, but it is a 4 person tent weighing around 20<small>kg</small> if not more!
I do also have a sleeping bag, but it's heavy, thick and not water or windproof.
Same goes for pretty much everything I currently have at home.

<br class='clearfix'/>

Its either too old and broken,
Or too thick and heavy. 
Worst comes to worst I will start my Pilgrimage with these heavier things, and hope I can upgrade along the way. 


<div class='clearfix'></div>

**But if I could help it, getting a bit better prepared,** <br/>
**it would certainly be worth the effort!** <br/>
