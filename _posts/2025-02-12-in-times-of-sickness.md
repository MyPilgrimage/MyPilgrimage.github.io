As I recently came down with the flu rather badly 
I was shocked with how little energy I had to get to my feet. 
Due to not having gotten groceries yet, 
there was no easy accessible way for me to replenish this energy.


A "last resort ration" is maybe something that would be good to have, 
think along the lines of a protein bar or other energy dense food.

## Technical Update

The new web page seems easy to use now, and if all goes right, 
the creation of new posts should be easily done even through my smartphone. 
I will still want to tweak a few things about the homepage, 
but I think I'm almost ready to publish the new site.


First I do want to try to make it dual-lingual, 
but if that fails, 
I will keep posting in English
