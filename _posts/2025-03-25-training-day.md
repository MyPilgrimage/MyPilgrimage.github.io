In my previous post I mentioned I haven't measured my latest hikes.
So to rectify this, 
I weighed my backpack and enabled my pedometer from the start.


## Results

<i class="far fa-clock fa-fw"></i>: 0h:52m:51s
<i class="fas fa-route fa-fw"></i>: 3km 905m
<i class="fas fa-person-running fa-fw"></i>: 4.4<sup>km</sup>/<sub>h</sub>
<i class="fas fa-weight-scale fa-fw"></i>: 9.76kg


## Thoughts

Pretty decent results. It was a nice walk without any issues.
I still need to make an appointment with my GP, 
my right leg started hurting at the end.


## Technical Update

While working on the Milestones update, 
I tried to change some things in the framework (Chirpy for Jekyll).
The "Further reading Section" could use some changes 
and I wondered if I could make these changes myself.
Luckily it seems to work 
and I've learned quite a few new things from "reverse engineering".

One thing that's great about the framework; 
I want to add a few functions and scripts to the page, 
luckily I don't need to write some of these scripts. 
Some functions are already in use in other places, on the site. 
So I can (re-)fit these functions in my custom pages.
(For example the Photo Album and the Welcome Post)
