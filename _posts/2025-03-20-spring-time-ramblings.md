## Random Ramblings

I do not think it's a controversial statement to say, 
that worldpolitics and such are pretty fucked at the moment. 
There is this massive divide between people, 
due to mis and disinformation. 
As in history, once the people live in a sort of "post truth" worldview, 
a strong leader that can speak to the common people is idolised. 
Through which authoritarian policies are applauded for their direct impact, 
creating a facade through self fulfilling prophecy.
And the frustrating thing is, 
both sides feel this applies to the opposition.
