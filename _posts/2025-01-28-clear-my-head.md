I needed to clear my head, so I went for a walk. <br/>


Walked for approx 15<small>km</small>. 
The wind and rain didn't bother me, 
but I did get a reminder on how important a good backpack is. 
Due to the straps on my shoulder bag, 
weighing heavily on my shoulders and causing discomfort.


I've also had some feedback from some people I respect and trust, 
which made me doubt my whole effort and plan. 
While I know I shouldn't take it so negatively, 
I find it hard not to.


Ending on a bit of a sour note, 
But I expect there will be more hardships to come. <br/>
and I'm not a very positive person.
