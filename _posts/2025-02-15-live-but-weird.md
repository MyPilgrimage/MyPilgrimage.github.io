## The page is live!

But sadly it would seem I made a few mistakes in deploying the site. 


## Technical Update

![Broken website](/assets/img/wip/img_brokenWebsite.png)
_Broken website. This doesn't look right..._
{: .img .w-50 .right }


I think it has to do with the fact that I used the original `_sass` folder for the style, 
while I should've used the assets/CSS instead.


Many elements on the site do not display correctly 
and there is also the issue with the Tags and Categories tabs. 
I wanted only to have one page for the Tags and Categories, 
but this created a deployment error. 
So this I will need to fix somehow, 
because I would still like the functionality of these Tags and Categories.

**But anyway, the new site is live! Now only to fix it 😉**
