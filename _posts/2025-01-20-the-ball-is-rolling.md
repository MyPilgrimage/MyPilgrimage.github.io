Today I had another great training session, 
this time I weighed my backpack. 
I improved it by attaching a few pouches 
and my bidon to its belt! <br/>


This was an instant improvement, 
because I could easily reach my water and phone.
I also started my pedometer at the start of the hike 
and these are the results: <br/>


## Results

I put **8<small>kg</small>** of weight in the form of dumbbells in my backpack;<br/>
- making for a total weight of **13.8<small>kg</small>** 
  (*Excluding a half litre of water.*)<br/> 
- I've walked **5<small>km</small>** 
- in **1<small>hr</small>** **6<small>minutes</small>** <br/>
- with an average speed of **4.5<sup>km</sup>/<sub>h</sub>**. <br/>


## Thoughts

The route I took was a bit more "adventurous" with a few minor elevation and dirt paths.
I took off one of my undershirts, which made my back a whole lot less sweaty, then last time. One thing I noticed is that I have the tendency to put most of my stuff on the left side of my backpack, making it a bit unbalanced. This caused my left shoulder and neck muscles to quickly get sore. <br/>

And good walking-boots is something I will need to invest in!


I'm also in the process of getting singing lessons and trying to teach myself how to play the harmonica. I figured this might be a nice way to make a little extra cash along the way. Or at the very least boost my self esteem.


Tomorrow I'll join my mother's hiking group, as they have planned a hike through the dunes in Schoorl. I'm a bit nervous because they are seasoned hikers and walk at a steady pace of (*at least*) 5<sup>km</sup>/<sub>h</sub>!


But I'm looking forward to the extra difficulty the hike and speed will bring! <br/>
All in all, another great day! <br/>
