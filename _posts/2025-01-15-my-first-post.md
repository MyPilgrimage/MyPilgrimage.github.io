## Hi,

Creating this page helps me with making a concrete plan 
and to share my plan with family and friends. 
This way it feels like something that's actually in motion 
and I can easily explain to people what my idea/plan is. 
Also I hope this will make me more proactive in actually going, 
because the doubt and fear I feel, is still very strong. 
I do hope I don't come across as an over-privileged whining whiteboy, 
but that's not for me to decide. 


Anyway, I've never kept a diary, blog nor even a social-media account. 
So sharing my story with the internet is not something I'm used to, 
nor do I feel like I have a story to tell or share. 


So here I am, safely at home dreaming about my Pilgrimage, 
but this feels like the first step towards going. 


**Southward Bound!**
