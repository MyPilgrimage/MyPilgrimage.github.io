I love spring and summer 
and the weather recently has been pretty good!
The sunlight has quite an impact on my overall mood. 
Not that this is particularly strange,
I've heard a lot of people saying this applies to them too.


I've taken advantage of the warmer weather, 
by going outside for most of the time while I'm working on this page. 
So much so that I've left a clear indent on the grass. 
Obviously I try to keep it as clean as possible.
Leaving only ash, hairs and footprints 😋

I make sure to charge my laptop 
and bring an USB-C cable to attach my phone.
Then enable USB tethering and I'm good to go!
And of course a thermos of coffee is always nice.


So this spot has in a way become my outside office 😁
