I try to keep persistent with my hiking-training, 
but I have to admit that my cardio training has somewhat fallen to the wayside. 
Slowly I'm trying to find my motivation again, 
and to keep on pushing myself.


Luckily working on this page seems to work!

## Technical Update

I'm diving into the deployment method of Github Pages, named Jekyll. 
The idea is to create a reactive page where I can easily add blog-posts. 
I can see that it is possible with Jekyll, 
and since I have a little experience with React, 
I recognised a few things.


So this is a new programming-language for me, 
but we'll see if I can make it work. 
At the very least having my Blog Posts as separate files, 
makes navigating the files a lot easier to fix spelling and mistakes.
