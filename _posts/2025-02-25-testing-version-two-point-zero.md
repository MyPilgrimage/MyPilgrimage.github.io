## Technical Update  

This will be in preperation for the **Version 2.0** announcement.<br/>
There are a lot of new features added to the website, 
aswell as many rewrites and gramar/spelling/syntac fixes.
This update will contain a complete version update, 
as I move away from small incremental updates 
and start working in larger "Post-by-Post" updates. 
I will hopefully have setup the correct IDE 
to test the Development branch correctly before deploying 
(*Something I haven't gotten working correctly as of yet*)


I want to see if this post will auto publish tomorrow. <br/>
It should appear on `25-02-2025 @ 12:00.` <br/>
While I'm writing this on `25-02-2025 @ 02:00` <br/>

**Version 2.0** will be my backup or restore point, 
if I break the website again.
If this happens I will update throught the **NEW** [<i class='fab fa-reddit'></i>  Reddit page  <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square'></i>](https://www.reddit.com/user/I-Jun_Pilgrimage/) <br/>

The old Reddit account (*/u/CutNo303/*) was immediately suspended on creation.. 
Sadly it seems that the same happened to my */u/I-Jun_Pilgrimage/* account. 
I've appealed the suspension two times already, 
with no luck. 
I will soon try for a third time, 
if nothing happens I think I'll delete the Reddit Account.
