I've been busy with trying to get the site to work and display correctly 
and I think I finally managed to get it right!
I like that the site takes a lot of the automation out of my hands, 
I can practically upload a text-file 
and the site will add it to the blog posts correctly!

This makes it extremely usable for me to be able to post while hiking.
I do not need to be extra careful not to break something, 
or continuously copy+paste sections or styling.


*So yeah, looking good!*


## Technical Update

I've created an Email address, [@ iJun.Pilgrimage@gmail.com](mailto:iJun.Pilgrimage@gmail.com) 
so I can send and receive correspondence. <br/>
I managed to add a simple Countdown timer to the [Quick Overview](/welcome#quick-overview),
 which I really like! <br/>
Now I only need to find a way to embed a Location-share app, 
but this is something I will try to implement later.


Soon I'll proof-read my texts again, 
to fix spelling errors, change syntax and add new info. <br/>
But having the page work as I wanted, gives me a lot of energy!

**Updates soon!**
