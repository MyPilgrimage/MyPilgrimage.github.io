While hiking I found a great walking stick!

Luckily I found it right near my house, 
so taking it along with me was no trouble at all.
While I was walking I thought of a modification to the walking stick; 
what if I try to make it into a camping seat? 
A three legged stool, 
with a triangle seating.

Below is a sketch of what my plan is.


![Step 1, 2](/assets/img/stick/walkingSeat-1.png)
{: .img .w-25 .right }

1. Cut the stick into three equal pieces.
2. Bore a hole on either end, to fit a bolt
3. Add a bolt to one side of each stool-leg. <br/>
   To attach the pieces back together.
   ![Step 2, 3](/assets/img/stick/walkingSeat-2.png)
   {: .img .w-25 .right }
4. Get a strong piece of fabric. <br/>
   (research this)
5. Fold a square of the fabric,
   into an equal sided triangle.
6. Punch eyelets into the fabric on each corner. <br/>
   Big enough for the flat bolts to fit into.
   ![Step 6, 8](/assets/img/stick/walkingSeat-3.png)
   {: .img .w-25 .right }
7. Get a backpack strap and clip buckle. <br/>
   This will go around the center of the legs, 
   tying them together.
   ![Step 6, 7, 9](/assets/img/stick/walkingSeat-4.png)
   {: .img .w-25 .right }
8. Get a backpack strap. <br/>
   The length of which should be measured
   once the seat is being assembled, 
   so you can see the distance of the legs, 
   from the triangle of the seat.
9. Punch eyelets where the leg-bolt meets the strap. <br/>
   Make sure the strap is under tension, 
   so the seat is not too strained.
   ![Step 10, 11](/assets/img/stick/walkingSeat-5.png)
   {: .img .w-25 .right }
10. Reattach the legs to make a walking stick.
11. Make bolt holes to attach the seat and straps, 
    so the stool has all its components.
<br/>

I have no idea if this project will turn out how I've got it planned. 
But if I could make my seating instantly accessible it would be quite a luxury! 😁


Also I've had a few singing lessons and 
it is going way better than I expected!
I've always thought I sang off-key, 
luckily this doesn't seem to be the case.
So yeah, 
not entirely self-assured enough to sing out loud, 
but at least I know I'm not singing out of tune.
