## Technical Update

I've created a Reddit account 
[<i class="fab fa-reddit fa-fw"></i> /u/CutNo303 <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square'></i>](https://www.reddit.com/user/I-Jun_Pilgrimage/) <br/>
I did not pick the username, 
but it seems like that’s normal for a new reddit account. 😅 <br/>
I’ll mainly use this account as another way to get in contact with me. 
It will also serve as a “down-detector”, 
if the website is down for whatever reason, I’ll update on the Reddit profile.  


I’ve started to vary the 
[<i class='fas fa-stream fa-fw'></i> Categories](https://mypilgrimage.github.io/categories/) 
of the website more.  
On the categories page all blog posts are categorized by type. 
- [<i class='fas fa-person-digging fa-fw'></i> Category: Site Posts](https://mypilgrimage.github.io/categories/site/)
  is used for posts specifically about the webpage.
- [<i class='fas fa-leaf fa-fw'></i> Category: 2025 Trial Run Posts](https://mypilgrimage.github.io/categories/2025-trial-run/)
  contains the posts and updates about my trial-run.
- And the newest category; [<i class='fas fa-head-side-virus fa-fw'></i> Category: Rambling Posts](https://mypilgrimage.github.io/categories/random/) 
  where I post some of my thoughts or concerns in general. 
  Basically where I ramble about random stuff.
<br/>
  
I've made the new category so, 
if you don't want to read posts that aren't about the hike, 
you can more easily find relevant posts!

Another way of sorting my posts is through 
[<i class='fas fa-tags fa-fw'></i> the Tags page](https://mypilgrimage.github.io/tags/) <br/>
Especially useful if you (*for example*), 
try to find all Pictures I’ve taken, you could filter by clicking 
[<i class='fas fa-tag fa-fw'></i><i class='fas fa-camera'></i> Pictures Tags](https://mypilgrimage.github.io/tags/pictures)

And ofcourse for a chronological order of blog posts, 
see 
[<i class='fas fa-timeline fa-fw'></i> the Timeline](https://mypilgrimage.github.io/timeline/) <br/>


## Random Ramblings

Is it me or has the weather been crazy in North-Holland the last few days. <br/>
Not even three days ago, the temperature was below 0℃, 
cold enough to freeze over smaller waterways overnight. 
But now the weather has shifted completely and it feels almost like spring.
While still being the end of February. <br/>
Sometimes I wonder if this is climate change in action. 
That we, in our lifetime, will never experience a harsh winter again. 
Not that I want to experience harsh winters 
(*I don't really like the cold* 😋). 
But it's more a random concern I have. <br/>
Here's hoping I'm wrong about this.
