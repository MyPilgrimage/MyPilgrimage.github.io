While I still need to restart with my complete training regimen, 
I do take long hikes almost every day. 
Also I've been to two singing lessons so far and I'm really enjoying it!

I do still need to make an appointment with my GP, 
because I can feel my feet and knees hurting after only short walks.


## Technical Update

I've made the decision to work with a new Jekyll Theme template 
called [Chirpy by Cotes Chung <i class='fas fa-up-right-from-square'></i>](https://chirpy.cotes.page/) <br/>
I’m getting the IDE for development to work and then will try to migrate from the old theme to the new. 
This theme has a lot more features, especially for a blog-like website.
The only downside so far seems to be that deploying the site is a bit more difficult.


But I'm hoping to be familiar enough with Jekyll by the time I'm traveling, 
so that I don't need to have a full IDE-suite to post from.
