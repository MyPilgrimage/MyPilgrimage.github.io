Me and three friends are going on a weekend camping trip!
It's becoming a bit of a tradition, we try to get together and plan a trip somewhere in the Netherlands, to camp for a weekend, in the spring vacation.

On these vacations, we hang out, go sightseeing and go for walks. These are the same friends with whom I also go into "pinkster" walks. I've taken the photos in Schoorl in 2024 during one of these hikes.

Now one of these friends maybe has some hiking gear to lend! It's not 100% confirmed yet, but he might have a lightweight, waterproof sleeping bag.
And maybe some more gear. This friend has quite some experience hiking himself, so I can learn a lot from his experiences.

I'm going to double check if they are okay with me referring to them by their first name or not. It would make writing about our hikes and camping trips a bit easier.
