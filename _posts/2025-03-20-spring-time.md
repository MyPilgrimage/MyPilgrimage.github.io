It's officially Spring 🌼!
And I thought it was
high time to update on some things.


## Thoughts

The weather these past few days has been great! I've been outside working on this page so much that I've almost depleted all of my mobile roaming MBs.

I'm quite happy with the way the site looks so far! I still want to update, change and rearrange some things, but I like the way it's coming together.


## Progress 

I'm still not back to my complete training regime.
The past weeks have been quite hectic and I haven't found the motivation yet to pick it back up.

I do still walk quite a lot, with a smaller backpack, mostly packed with my laptop, coffee and some snacks. I haven't been measuring these hikes, so I have no result to compare.

On that note, I got a great tip to set out milestones for myself. To give me a goal to strive towards and to get me active again. I'm currently in the process of setting these milestones and displaying them in the (
[Quick-Overview](/welcome/#quick-overview) and the [About section](/about/). More on this in the Technical update.

My singing lessons are also going great. It's an enormous boost to my self-confidence and I really enjoy the lessons. I also finally picked up the harmonica, mainly just trying things out by myself, but soon I'll going to check YouTube for some tutorials.


## Technical Update

![Progress bars - Work in Progress](/assets/img/wip/progbar-wip.jpg)_Progress bars - Work in Progress_

As you can see in the screenshot, I'm trying to make a progress bar with "train stop"-milestones. I think this is a nice visual way to show my progress on things. I've mainly focussed on the style (CSS) part of the milestones, the scripting (JS) does still need quite some work. I can currently fill the progress bar through a script, but I also want the milestones to reflect the progression by script, to only fill the progress bar once it's in view and to create clickable "more info" popUps. For all these things I mainly use W3Schools, as I've always found it a useful resource and solid starting point.


## Random Ramblings

I do not think it's a controversial statement to say, that worldpolitics and such are pretty fucked at the moment. There is this massive divide between people, due to mis and disinformation. As in history, once the people live in a sort of "post truth" worldview, a strong leader that can speak to the common people is idolised. Through which authoritarian policies are applauded for their direct impact, creating a facade through self fulfilling prophecy.
And the frustrating thing is, both sides feel this applies to the opposition.
