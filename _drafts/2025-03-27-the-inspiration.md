The first time I went on a long hike, 
I think I was around 16 or 17 years old.
I finished high school a year before and to be brief, 
I did not have a great time there, 
due to many of my fellow classmates.

The bike ride to and from school was always stressful. 
It was a distance of 18.5km. 
Of which approximately 15km, 
I had to "share" with those classmates.
Due to me being uncomfortable and anxious, 
I always rode my bike as fast as possible.

A minor side effect of this was, 
that I never looked at my surroundings. 
All the while the route I cycled everyday 
was gorgeous, 
from the farm fields towards the dunes 
and through forests.

One day I found myself back in the town 
where my old highschool is located, 
without a bicycle. 
And I decided then and there to walk the way home.
To make the journey without the stress and fear.
So I bought a few drinks, snacks and some food 
and started walking.

Of course the route was very familiar to me.
But for the first time, 
I took the chance to really look.
The only deadline I set for myself was, 
try be back before dark, 
but nothing else.
It felt a kind of therapeutic.

I took a few pictures along the way.
I'm going to upload the once I really like.
And I'm going to create an album-like layout on the photos tab.
More on this below, in the technical update.

I don't recall how long I walked for that day.
I took my time and enjoyed long breaks.
This experience allowed me to look with different eyes.
I could get another perspective on life.
Nothing mayor or revelatory.
But just the idea of trying to 
seperate the world you construct inside your own head 
and the world that physically exists.
And just **be** there for a moment.

So although I don't remember how late I arrived home.
I know I walked around 19km
and I enjoyed it very much.

## Technical Update

..
I've made quite good progress on the next page update
Currently I'm in the process of adding a space on the homepge,
In this space I want the Quick Overview content will be displayed.
Currently all these elements run on local scripts inside the post.
But creating a seperate module in Jekyll will give me more freedom and
allows me to implement the exsisting fuctions more easily.
I'm still quite anxious to push these updates to the live branch,
but once I've tested it more, this will be the next mayor update.
...
As mentioned above, one part of the update will be a photo-display update.
I want to create the Photo Album as a module in Jekyll.
Instead of just a tab with a lot of pictures, also categorize photos in Albums.
A minor update is adding descriptions or tags to the lightbox of photos.
This way important context isn't lost in the large-picture view.


## Small Update
After writing the post I searched my harddrive for the pictures.
Luckily they still all had their original timestamp.
Even though I do not have the original pictures, 
like for example the non-sepia version of the last picture.

Apparent from the timestamps, I walked X for X

Also below a googlemaps view of the route.
